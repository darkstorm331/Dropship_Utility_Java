# Dropship_Utility_Java
A program created in Java using Amazon's API to list products for me from a Dropshipping site called Puckator

I created this application in my spare time to improve my coding abilities and to earn some extra money on the side. This application was
written in Java because I had it running on a Raspberry Pi 24/7. Every 30 minutes it would execute and manage my Amazon listings from a
Dropshipping site called Puckator. It did this by downloading the XML feed from Puckator of their products and then listing or de-listing things
as necessary.

This application uses Amazon instead of eBay because I wanted to try the APIs of both platforms
